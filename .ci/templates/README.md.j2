## About

This repo contains a collection of containers which are optimized for use in kubernetes, and updated automatically to keep up with upstream versions. Using an image effectively in Kubernetes requires a few ingredients:

- The filesystem must be able to be immutable
- Semantic versioning is available to specify exact versions to run
- The container can be run rootless
- The container shouldn't require any manual interaction
- The container should ideally be configurable via environmental variables

## Configuration volume

For applications that need to have persistent configuration data the container will leverage a `/data` and a `/config` volume where these are necessary. This is not able to be changed in most cases.

---

## Available Tags

For Semantically Versioned containers (e.g. `v1.2.3`), `major`, `major.minor`, and `major.minor.patch` tags will be generated, for example, ![1](https://img.shields.io/badge/1-blue?style=flat-square) ![1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.2-blue?style=flat-square) and ![1.2.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.2.3-blue?style=flat-square). Available Images Below.

### Application Images

Each Image will be built with a `rolling` tag, along with tags specific to it's version. Available Images Below

Container | Channel | Image
--- | --- | ---
{% for image in app_images | sort(attribute='name') -%}
[{{ image.name }}]({{ image.html_url }}) | {{ image.channel }} | ghcr.io/{{ image.owner }}/{{ image.name }}
{% endfor %}
